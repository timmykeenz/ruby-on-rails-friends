# Ruby on Rails

This project followed a tutorial series to learn about Ruby on Rails (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyvWz5TUWg&t=11194s).  The series taught me how to work with the basic CRUD operations and familiarizing myself with how backend frameworks operate.  The application has a login system using Devise and builds a friends table to keep track of your friends on a per-user basis.

Versions:
* Ruby version - 2.7.2p137
* Rails version - 6.1.1
